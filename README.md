# 🌧️ Rainfall Prediction using Random Forest

This project predicts rainfall using a **Random Forest Regression** model trained on historical weather data. It helps in understanding how various environmental factors contribute to rainfall and can serve as a basic predictive model for weather forecasting applications.

## 📌 Features

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Feature Selection
- Model Training with Random Forest Regressor
- Evaluation using MAE, MSE, and R² Score
- Visualization of Predictions

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains weather-related features such as:
- `MinTemp`: Minimum temperature
- `MaxTemp`: Maximum temperature
- `Humidity`
- `Pressure`
- `WindSpeed`
- `Rainfall`: Target variable

Dataset (`rainfall_data.csv`) is placed in the same directory as the script.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
